      <h1>Verse 1</h1>
      <p>Through storms and silence, we hold on tight,<br>
      Distance may linger, but we'll make it right.<br>
      Some nights feel like walking on glass,<br>
      Afraid one crack could make us collapse.<br>
      But even when shadows stretch too long,<br>
      Your voice reminds me where I belong.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h1>Verse 2</h1>
      <p>Moonlight shines where my hands can't go,<br>
      But somehow, you’re always here, I know.<br>
      Pages turn, our story grows,<br>
      Laughter in movies only we know.<br>
      You showed me love is safe and real,<br>
      A place to breathe, a place to heal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h1>Verse 3</h1>
      <p>One day, the miles won’t keep us apart,<br>
      No more waiting, no more aching heart.<br>
      I’ll wake beside you, hold you close,<br>
      Feel your warmth, the touch I know.<br>
      No more distance, no more in-between,<br>
      Just you, my baby, right here with me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h1>Verse 4</h1>
      <p>On this day, I just want you to see,<br>
      You’re my forever, my love, my plea.<br>
      No chocolates or roses could ever compare,<br>
      To the love we’ve built, the life we’ll share.<br>
      So take my words and keep them tight—<br>
      Happy Valentine’s, my love, my light.</p>
